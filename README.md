# Background

X Reality (XR or Cross Reality) is defined as: a form of “mixed reality environment that comes from the fusion (union) of ubiquitous sensor/actuator networks and shared online virtual worlds. It encompasses a wide spectrum of hardware and software, including sensory interfaces, applications, and infrastructures, that enable content creation for virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), augmented reality (AR), cinematic reality (CR). With these tools, users generate new forms of reality by bringing digital objects into the physical world and bringing physical world objects into the digital world.

HoloXR uses AR to create a live view of a real-world environment (“reality”) with computer-generated input (sound, 3D Machinery graphics, 3D text, 360 video, and GPS information) and thus supplementing (“augmenting”) the visual elements in the view.
Using 3-D AR systems enables real tasks to be completed with the help of virtual agents.  3-D AR, mechanical technology learners disassembling an engine will see live, real-time directions overlaid on the parts set out in front of them, and a 360 video showing exactly what steps to take next. We use object detection and segmentation software to create high-quality and accurate content for computer-aided design (CAD) models.

# Problem Statement

The Key Challenges that are inherent in the technical
education sector in the Republic of South Africa:
• Infrastructure, outdated equipment and machinery; teachers were not up to date
with the trends of industry;
• Learning and teacher support material (LTSM), which requires updating;
• The collapse of partnerships that existed between Technical Schools and
industry, which has created a major gap in affording learners work experience
whilst affording industries an opportunity to contribute to schools in preparing
learners for the world of work.
•The above have negative
ramifications in terms of learner participation and teacher retention
Instructional Augmented Reality for Technology Education 


# Educational objective:
Real time access to virtual equipment and machinery, linking movements and AR feedback systems, to enhance task performance on cognitive tasks.
# Implementation and context:
Quite fine granular registration of real world overlays is used to implement instructional environments in AR.

# Main Components
1. Virtual Media: 3D Equipment and machinery
2. Sharing virtual media: Learners may share 3D models or link to real world objects for other learners to access.
3. Collaboration: Learners may collaborate on completing cognitive tasks
4. Educator Portal: Teachers may assign tasks to learners and use the dashboard to obtain learner progress

Main Users: Learners and Teachers

# Tools and SDK: 
These are the tools used to generate debug and optimize content
We use vuforia for digital content storage and augmenting 3D models.
We use opencv for background segementation and object tracking
Intel® GPA
(Intel GPA is a powerful, free graphics performance analyzer tool, which can be downloaded at https://software.intel.com/en-us/gpa)

System Analyzer: Real-time display of game performance indicators.
Graphics Frame Analyzer: The frame analyzer.
